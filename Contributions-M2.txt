Team worked together on Discord voice-calls, usually with a team member sharing a screen. To avoid merge conflicts in the Java App CookBook, code was shared in txt files. Xan and Newton focused on fixing issues left over from v0.5, and creating objects, while Zack and John worked on SQL queries. John created a separate database in Datagrip to help with the writing of queries, and also research implementing SQL queries in JPA. Zack wrote most of the SQL queries. Working on fixing errors, getting SQL queries to run and other progress on the final two of the project was done in collaboration, with team members assisting each other over voice chat.
