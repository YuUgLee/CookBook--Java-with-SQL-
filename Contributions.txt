Contributions Document


        Team06 began collaborating on 4/7/21 over discord in order to complete Cookbook v0.5. Using the UML, the team divided up two java classes per team member to begin working. In order to avoid conflicting merges into the team’s Github repository, team members primarily made updates to their own java classes, and any new classes, or changes made to other classes were first discussed as a team. The CookBook class containing the main was worked on by the most team members.  A relational schema diagram was created using input from each team member. Meetings occurred frequently, with each meeting ending with the team setting the next soonest meeting time that at least two team members could attend.
